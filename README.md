## Documenting UFO sightings with Javascript

#### Overview

The intention of this project was to construct a site with a dynamic filtering system with Javascript, the purpose of which is to document different instances of UFO sightings. HTML and CSS were to be used in conjuction as well to construct and style the website which held the data and filtering program.

#### Analysis & Conclusion

Using a series of Javascript function, as well as d3 to pull to the website I was able to extract raw data from the data.js file and repurpose it so that each UFO instance could be found individual via several search filters. Some difficulty during this was in trying to get the syntax exactly right, as Javascript appears to be a bit more constrained in comparison with prior used languages, such as Python. That being said it still remains a powerful tool to use when applied in the correct manner.
